üëã Hi there!

Known for being curious, creative, and collaborative. As a generalist, I excel at learning how things work, problem-solving, and adapting to new challenges quickly. I have a proven history of creating and implementing successful front-end designs and full-stack web applications.

#### üèóÔ∏è What I'm Currently Working On

##### Bad Gateway

A cross-platform top-down story-driven action-adventure indie game set in a near-future cyberpunk world. I am using Blender and [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) to create this magnum opus.

##### Community Taught
